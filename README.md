## Project Descriptions
This repository includes multiple assignments completed during my internship at ST. Each project focuses on different aspects of digital design and verification. Highlights include:

1. **64-bit Brent-Kung Adder**:
   - Hierarchical design principles.
   - Modularization using parameterized components.
   - Optimized combinational logic for performance.

2. Additional Projects:
   - [Insert description of other projects, e.g., Multiplier Design, ALU Implementation, etc.]

## Features
- Implementation of various digital design modules.
- Modular designs with reusable components.
- Testbenches for functional verification.
- Optimized code for readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
To run any of the projects locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

3. Ensure you have a Verilog simulation tool installed (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).

4. Navigate to the relevant project folder and run the testbench:
   ```bash
   <simulator-command> <testbench-file>.v
   ```

## Usage
This repository can serve as:
- A reference for hierarchical and modular digital design.
- Examples for implementing prefix adders, multipliers, and other digital modules in Verilog.
- A basis for further optimization and scaling of arithmetic logic units and other components.
